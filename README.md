# Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio Project** 🚀  
This repository documents my hands-on journey in building a modern data warehouse and analytics solution. As a student learning **data engineering and analytics**, I wanted to experience how real-world projects are structured in industry — from raw data ingestion to actionable insights.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Design scalable **data architecture** using Medallion layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- Build **ETL pipelines** for extracting, transforming, and loading data
- Develop **fact and dimension tables** optimized for analytics
- Deliver **SQL-based reporting** to uncover business insights

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture**:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from ERP & CRM CSV files into SQL Server.  
2. **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing, standardization, and normalization for consistency.  
3. **Gold Layer**: Business-ready star schema models for reporting and analytics.  

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipelines to move data across layers.  
- **Data Modeling**: Star schema design with fact and dimension tables.  
- **Analytics & Reporting**: SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.  

🎯 Through this project, I strengthened my skills in:
- SQL Development  
- ETL Pipeline Design  
- Data Modeling  
- Analytics & Reporting

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Data Engineering
- Import ERP & CRM datasets (CSV format) into SQL Server.  
- Cleanse and resolve data quality issues.  
- Integrate sources into a unified analytical model.  

### Analytics
- Write SQL queries to analyze:
  - Customer purchasing behavior  
  - Product performance metrics  
  - Sales trends over time
